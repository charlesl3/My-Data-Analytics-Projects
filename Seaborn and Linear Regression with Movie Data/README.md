## Learning Points & Summary 📝  

Today was a pretty packed lesson where we introduced a lot of new concepts. In this lesson, we explored how to:  

- **Use nested loops 🔄 to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns**  
- **Filter Pandas DataFrames 📊 based on multiple conditions using both `.loc[]` and `.query()`**  
- **Create bubble charts 🔵 using the Seaborn library**  
- **Style Seaborn charts 🎨 using pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters**  
- **Use floor division (`//`) ➗ to convert years to decades**  
- **Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regression 📈 over our data**  
- **Make a judgment 🤔 on our regression’s quality based on model fit and the r-squared metric**  
- **Run regressions with scikit-learn 🤖 and calculate the coefficients**
