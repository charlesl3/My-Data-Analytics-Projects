- Styled **Seaborn charts** using pre-built styles and modified Matplotlib parameters.  
- Used **floor division (`//`)** to convert years to decades.  
- Superimposed a **linear regression** over our data using Seaborn.  
- Evaluated regression quality based on **model fit and the r-squared metric**.  
- Ran **regressions with scikit-learn** and calculated the coefficients.
